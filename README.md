Solving the problems for ProjectEuler.org

This is my attempt to get back into coding after 13 years.  In order to refresh my skills, I have taken to working on solving the problems located at ProjectEuler.org.

I ask that no one edits or makes changes to this code as it is my own work and intended for me.
